# understanding_distributed_systems
`If you can possible do without distributed systems you should do it`
By why
high performance through parellism
tolerate fault 
Natural physical reasons - talking too banks at different locations
Security Goal 


Problems
- Concurreny problems
- Multiple pieces plus a network so many failure problems
- Often to get performance but it is tricky to do it

We will talk about Systems that provide / Abstractions
 - storage
 - Communication
 - Computation

- Abstractions
 Rpc
 Threads
 Concurrency control
 
 Performance
  - Scalability
